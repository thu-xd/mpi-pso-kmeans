This is a mpi implementation of the kmeans+pso cluster algorithm. In this implementation, 
seperate kmeans or pso cluster algorithm can be applied to dataset cluster. 
More important, pso cluster algorithm can to used to give better initilized clusters' center for 
kmeans cluster algorithm, which helps kmeans to escape from local minimization.

1. Using make to compile the program, I have writen the makefile, you just need to run make in the
   current directory. (I have already compiled for you if you don't have make)
2. Run "./main --help" to see the help information. If you think the help information is awesome,
   "mpirun -n 7 --oversubscribe ./main"  will run the parallel k-means algorithm
   "mpirun -n 7 --oversubscribe ./main --mode=pso" will run the parallel pso algorithm
   "mpirun -n 7 --oversubscribe ./main --mode=hybrid" will run the paraller pso+kmeans algorithm
3. Email me if have any problem xied15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn
